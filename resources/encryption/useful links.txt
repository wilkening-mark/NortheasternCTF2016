Here are some useful links for encryption

The TPM has a random number generator that can be used to increase entropy with rng-tools. gnupg can take advantage of this, so it seems like a good way to generate our RSA keys would be with GPG. There is a python GPG library, and here are two very good resources I found:

https://pythonhosted.org/python-gnupg/
http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2011/10/python-gnupg-gpg-example/

The first is setting up rng-tools to use the TPM, and then the second two are about using gpg. I did a test on the beaglebone generating gpg keys, without the rng-tools service running it was not able to generate a key, while with it running it only took a few seconds.
