I've been using vagrant with a debian vm to run the server from, this seemed like a good way to keep track of what is going on in the server environment. I've just been running the server from /vagrant. Right now we just need socat on the machine, but if we need to add anything this should make it so anyone can plug in the beaglebone (provided they have the drivers) and then be ablet to run the server
