	- Assigned chips on the board - Research ways to use them (by Monday)
		- Write some Psuedo-code
	- Continue with things from the previous Week
	- Reach out to eCTF team and ask about extra week (Erin)
	- Come up with a more complete timeline (checking with Profs etc.)
	- Networks prof meeting in ~2 weeks
	- Get Git Setup for those who don't
	- If you write code - post it in the group and ask for review

# Feb 1 
	- Sam, Erin, Victoria, Nick, Emily
	- TPM Keys Discussion (Victoria, Nick)
	- Flags location (Erin)
	- For Friday : Code and Patches (bring something to test)
	- Plan for Friday : Implement and test some patches
	- Get more exp actually running the device and things
	- Keep stuff on Git - allows us to keep tabs on progress
	- Have assigned goals and deadlines each week
	- Nick and Victoria - work on encripting server packets
	- Look at list, prioritize, assign tasks (Sam, Erin, Emily) Mon/Tues

# Feb 5  
	- Mark - RSA & Encription - working on merging w/Nick's stuff - Prevent multiple packets @ once 
	- Kim - JSON, Protect packets - valid data
	- Went through Attacks/Patch doc, status
	- Ran BBB (Mark, Ben, Kim)  tested some of the code
	- For upcoming week - any YELLOW boxes should be tested / merged if posible 
	- Merge MITRE's code into our branch (done)
	- Figure out how to run with the new stuff (Kim)
	- Knowledge transfer (So we all know how to run the BBB, notes about best practices, debug stuff)
#Feb 9th
	-Nick and Victoria: pulling timestamps from BBB, network and formatting the dates 
	-if the timestamps match, then continue forward with connection 		-after working on this, we see the need for creating unit testing for our code because it's easy for things to break and hard to pinpoint the source
	-once the timestamp code is working, Nick and Victoria will move forward with encrypting via the ECC
