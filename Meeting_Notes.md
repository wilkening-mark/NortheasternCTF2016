#Feb 9th
	-Nick and Victoria: pulling timestamps from BBB, network and formatting the dates 
	-if the timestamps match, then continue forward with connection 		-after working on this, we see the need for creating unit testing for our code because it's easy for things to break and hard to pinpoint the source
	-once the timestamp code is working, Nick and Victoria will move forward with encrypting via the ECC
