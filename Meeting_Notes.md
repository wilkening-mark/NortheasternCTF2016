	- Knowledge transfer (So we all know how to run the BBB, notes about best practices, debug stuff)

#Feb 9th
	-Nick and Victoria: pulling timestamps from BBB, network and formatting the dates 
	-if the timestamps match, then continue forward with connection 		
	-after working on this, we see the need for creating unit testing for our code because it's easy for         
	things to break and hard to pinpoint the source
	-once the timestamp code is working, Nick and Victoria will move forward with encrypting via the ECC   

#Feb 11
	- Victoria and Kim cleaned up timestamps stuff
	- Created unit tests for implementing

	- Ben created Requirements & Tests Document 
	- We set a "System Finished" Deadline Feb17/18 
	- Testing deadline Feb19/20
	- Spend last half week (until 24th handoff) verifying and making sure we meet reqs

	- This is crunch time - going to have to work together as a team to get this to go smoothly

#Feb 22 PM
	- Everyone but Mark
	- Meeting in Wireless Club to do testing and go through requirements
	- Verified that tenant PIN can be changed, LED indicates door opened correctly
	- Figured out Master PIN had to be change-able and shouldn't be hard coded 
	- Ben worked on that functionality
	- Some of the team tried to test other things but struggled with the Keys because of their location being hardcoded
	in Mark's code
	- Assigned tasks for the rest of the week.  Decided to meet Tuesday afternoon.
